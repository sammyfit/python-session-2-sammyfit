ðŸŽ¯ Program Description:
-----------------------
This program simulates a billing system for a toy store using basic arithmetic and conditional logic in Python.

âœ… What the program does:
- Asks the user to input their name and the number of toys purchased.
- Calculates the total cost based on a fixed toy price.
- Applies a discount based on the quantity of toys purchased:
    - < 5 toys  â†’ 2% discount
    - 5â€“10 toys â†’ 5% discount
    - > 10 toys â†’ 10% discount
- Adds an additional 2% tax if more than 50 toys are purchased.
- Calculates:
    - Total price before discount
    - Discount amount
    - Tax amount
    - Final payable amount after discount and tax
- Prints a friendly billing summary showing all the above.

ðŸ§  Concepts Covered:
- User input and type casting
- Conditional statements (if-elif-else)
- Arithmetic calculations (%, *, +, -)
- f-strings for clean output formatting
